### Xcode 12 bug note!

Xcode 12 now has a bug that causes static library .a files to be copied into the app bundle. Add `Run Script` to your Xcode project with this commands:

```
# Remove static libs
ls -1 ${CODESIGNING_FOLDER_PATH}/Contents/Frameworks/*.a
rm -f ${CODESIGNING_FOLDER_PATH}/Contents/Frameworks/*.a

```
